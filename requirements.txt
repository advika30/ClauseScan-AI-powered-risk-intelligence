#torch==2.0.1  <-- REMOVE or comment this out
# Add the specific CPU-only torch installation
torch==2.0.1+cpu  # This is a common way to specify CPU version for older torch.
                  # For newer torch versions, it might be just `torch`.
                  # It's best to check PyTorch's official installation guide for 2.0.1
                  # as the exact string might vary depending on the build.
                  # A safer bet might be `pip install torch==2.0.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`
                  # but you can't put that directly in requirements.txt
                  # So, relying on `torch` to resolve to a CPU version is usually fine for older versions.
